The motivation of this project was to refactor and target the Nordic code for Arduino to a PIC32. The code was simplified by removing unneeded data structures and functions to reduce and simplify the code base. Also, this project is event-driven and does rely on an interrupt vs polling.  It is specific to a UART-driven application. The use-case is for pushing bulk data (20-byte packets).

There are two parts to this project:
1. nRF8001 schematic and board (Eagle)
2. PIC 32 focused UART driver

The board uses only 0402 components to reduce mutual inductances so you will need a good magnifying system to lay down the components.  There is a board already created on OSHPark:

This can be tested by using Nordic's Android application called BLE-UART. Currently, the driver just sends back what was sent.

***NOTE: Android has a bug in the BLE code and will not refresh the characteristics. Please refer to this fix (hack):
